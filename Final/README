This program is to generate mipmaps from an input image. And display the mipmap and the original image together in a window. Users can scale the pixmap via the mousewheel to compare the differences between them. The user would see the aliasing artifacts on the mipmap less than the original image when the user scale down the image.

The program would load west.jpeg as a default

To compile: make
Usage: ./go [image_file_name]


keyboard controls:
Press up or down to zoom in and zoom out the image
Or scroll mouse wheel to zoom in and zoom out the image
Press q or Q exit the program

Problems:
I select the level of mipmap based on the zoom factor that users input. I think the level of mipmap I select does not match the size of the viewport perfectly.
