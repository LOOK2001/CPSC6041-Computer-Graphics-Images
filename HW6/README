The program can warp can warp an input image with matrix input into the new shape and write out the image to a file.

To compile: make
Usage: ./warp input_image_file [-b] [output_image_file]

matrix command:
r theta	counter clockwise rotation about image origin, theta in degree
s sx sy	scale
t dx dy	translate
h hx hy	shear
f fx fy	flip: if fx = 1 flip horizontally, fy = 1 flip vertically
p px py	perspective warp
d		done

keyboard controls:
n cx cy s	twirl

The examples of warped images are showen in the Result.pdf
The program will run with the projective warp as a default method.
If you want to use twirl warp, you need to press d to display the image first.
