Program will filter images using convolution from a convolutional kernel read from a filter file or gabor filter kernel generated from parameters using the OpenImageIO API and OpenGL

To compile: make

Usage: 
./convolve <filter_file_name> <input_file_name> [<output_file_name>]
or
./convolve <input_file_name> [<output_file_name>] <-g> <theta> <sigma> <peroid>

For example:

keyboard controls:
'c' pressed: Compute the convolution of the current image
'r' pressed: Reload the original image
'w' pressed: Write the currently displayed image to a file
'q' or ESC key is pressed: Program quits
