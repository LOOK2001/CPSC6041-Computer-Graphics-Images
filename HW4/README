There are two program here, Alphamask and Compose program.

To compile: make

Alphamask program:
Program generate alpha channel mask for an image based upon image color information using the OpenImageIO API.
You can modify thresholds value in the thresholds.txt. There are four value, hue_low, saturation, value, hue_high, in thresholds.txt file.
For hand.jpg, I use hue_low:75 100, saturation: 0.55 0.65, value: 0.25 0.65, hue_high: 110 180 to generate alpha channel.
Usage: alphamask <input_file_name> <output_file_name>
keyboard controls:
Alpha mask using chroma-keying method when o is pressed
Alpha mask using Petro Vlahos method when p is pressed
Spill suppression G = min(G, B) when s is pressed
Increase or decrease k value for Petro Vlahos method using UP and DOWN key
Program quits when either 'q' or ESC key is pressed


Compose program:
Program compose foreground and background image, displays the composed image using the OpenImageIO API.
I composed dhouse_alpha.png and pokemon_back_1.jpg to get result1.png, hand_alpha.png and pokemon_back_1,jpg to get result2.png.
Usage: compose <foreground_image_file> <background_image_file>
keyboard controls:
Program quits when either 'q' or ESC key is pressed
